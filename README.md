I'm a 17-year old Italian teenager, and love mathematics and computer science. I'm currently in high school pursuing A-levels in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computer science.

- Please view more information, such as my academic achievements and awards, on my [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-bonato-849734231/)
- Generally, I am very good at immersing myself into a problem, researching it, breaking it down and solving it (i.e. problem solving)
- I practice my algorithmic problem solving skills on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)
- I am willing and easily able to learn new skills and frameworks (e.g. Pytorch or a new language)
- Proficiency in Python and C++
- Able to understand and use documentation, for example to interact with API's (e.g. I made a Discord Bot using Discord's Bot API)

## Projects and work

- Please refer to my [Github projects page](https://github.com/MarcoBonato09?tab=repositories) for my large projects.
- I have also created other projects not included in the repository page (since code-wise they are not so impressive), such as:
  - A Neural network from scratch (except for the numpy library for matrix math)
  - A Discord bot using Discord's API
  - A script to scrape stories from reddit and compile them into short-form videos (e.g. for Youtube shorts)
  - And more lost to the sands of time (like my first hangman program in Python)
- You can view my algorithmic problem-solving practice on my [Codeforces page](https://codeforces.com/profile/marcobonato).

## Hobbies

- Mathematics
- Computer Science & programming
- Going out with friends
- Spending time with family
- Running
- Strength training
- Drawing
- Model United Nations (I have attended conferences such as [MUNish](https://munish.nl/), [HMUN](https://hmun.nl/) and [BSNMUN](https://bsnmun.com/))
