I'm a 17-year old Italian teenager, and love mathematics and computer science. I'm currently in high school pursuing A-levels in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computer science. I am predicted at A* (the highest grade) for all of them.

  - A Neural network from scratch (except for the numpy library for matrix math)
  - A Discord bot using Discord's API
  - A script to scrape stories from reddit and compile them into short-form videos (e.g. for Youtube shorts)
  - And more lost to the sands of time (like my first hangman program in Python)
- You can view my algorithmic problem-solving practice on my [Codeforces page](https://codeforces.com/profile/marcobonato).
